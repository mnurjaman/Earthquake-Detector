# Earthquake-Detector 

Case: 
- The Cianjur, Indonesia Earthquake in 2022, with a magnitude of 5.6, resulted in 327 deaths, 27,434 heavily damaged houses, 13,070 moderately damaged houses, and 22,124 lightly damaged houses, making a total of 62,628 houses damaged.

Solution? 
- An IoT device is required to detect earthquakes and emit real-time sound alerts.

The Cianjur earthquake has resulted in significant losses, and this is due to Indonesia's location between three tectonic plates: the Eurasian Plate, Indo-Australian Plate, and Pacific Plate. This geographical positioning leads to frequent earthquakes in Indonesia, causing significant material damage and loss of life. Despite the presence of the Meteorology, Climatology, and Geophysics Agency (BMKG), which provides regular updates and reports on natural disasters, not everyone possesses a smartphone during an earthquake. Hence, there is a need for a device that can directly alert the public with sound notifications during an earthquake, enabling them to take immediate measures to ensure their safety.

The Earthquake Detection Project is a mobile and Internet of Things project created using Wokwi, an online electronics simulation platform. The project utilizes Thingspeak as a website to display data from the Wokwi project, and MIT App Inventor as a platform to facilitate the development of simple applications without requiring extensive programming knowledge. With MIT App Inventor, users can design Android applications according to their preferences using various layouts and available components.

The project works as follows: the device detects earthquakes and emits sound alerts through a buzzer when vibrations occur. Meanwhile, through the smartphone application, users can view information such as temperature and earthquake movement graphs. However, a limitation of the application is the absence of smartphone notifications such as vibrations or sounds. Nevertheless, the audible warning sound from the device can be heard directly during an earthquake compared to relying solely on a smartphone.
